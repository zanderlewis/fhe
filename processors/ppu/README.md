# PPU
## Overview
The `Physics Processing Unit` (PPU) concept refers to a specialized microprocessor designed to handle physics-related calculations in video games and simulations. PPUs are dedicated hardware accelerators that offload physics computations from the main CPU, allowing for more realistic and complex physics simulations in real-time applications.

## Real-World Use Cases
1. **Physic Simulations**: PPUs can be used in scientific simulations, engineering applications, and other scenarios that require real-time physics calculations. For example, simulating fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, or electromagnetic fields can benefit from the parallel processing power of a PPU.

2. **Graphing and Data Visualization**: PPUs can accelerate graphing and data visualization tasks by offloading the computational load from the main CPU. This can be useful in applications that require real-time rendering of complex graphs, charts, and visualizations.
